Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering refers to the application of engineering tools, principles and methods in a systematic way , in the development and maintenance of hiigh-quality software systems. In the technology industry it enables crestion of effective and reliable software solutionds thart meet the users needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages, including Python, Java Scrpt and others.
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline
3. The rise of agile methodologies especialy in the 2000s that has seen the progression and advancement of the course

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: This involves documenting user needs and system requirements
2. Design: Involves cretion of quality and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation: Involves writing of code and building of the software according to the design agreed upon
4. Testing: Involves carrying out various tests to ensure the software meets functional requirements and quality standards
5. Deployment: Involves releasing of the software to the clients
6. Maintenance: Provision of ongoing support and updates to the software beyond deployment
   
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodolgy involves a systematic approach 0with distict phases tha flowdownwards mimicking  waterfall. Theses phases include:requirements, design and implementation. Agile methodology on the other hand involves iterativeapproach focused on flexibility, collaboration, responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
2. A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing plans
3. A project manager oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code and include Visual sudio and Eclipse
VCS enable tracking of changes to source code and coordinating work among team members and include Git and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
These inculde:
1. Tight deadlines
2. Technical debt
3. Changing requirements
To overcome these challenges,effective communication, prioritization of tasks, agile methodologiesand regular reassessment of project goals and timelines should be carried out

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing  tests individual componentsof software
2. Integration testing test interactions between different components or subsystems
3. System testing tests the entire software system as a whole
4. Acceptance testing tests software against user requirements to ensure user needs are met

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering  refers to the designing of prompts to effectively interact with AI models. It enables the AI models to better understand the information that is needed in order to get the best possible responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt: When did the war happen?
Example of a clear prompt: When did World War II happen?
The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies which war is being inquired about compared to the first prompt which was very general.
